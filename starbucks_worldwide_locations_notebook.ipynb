    "**Business Objective**: The main objective of the project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the number of Starbucks stores in a country based on a set of variables, such as GDP per capita, population, and easy of doing business. \n",

    "**Business Success Criteria**: For this project, the business success criteria have at least a 0.7 R-Squared value for the model's predictions.\n",

    "**Dataset**: Two datasets available on Kaggle were used for Starbucks numbers in countries. The first of them belongs to 2016, the other belongs to 2021. In addition, World Bank data were used for parameters such as GPD and population of countries. World Bank data was obtained with the wbgapi library.\n",
